# Experimental Beancount Projects and Prototypes

This repository contains projects and prototypes built on top of the Beancount
core repository (http://github.com/beancount/beancount). Various tools, ideas,
plugins, and other miscellanious Beancount-related codes are located here.

Most of the projects here are assume to work on top of Beancount's `master`
branch (a.k.a., v3).

WARNING: This is all experimental code, and there are no guarantees anything
will be stable or working. This is my playground. When something will be
nominated as stable, it will move to its own repository.


## Mailing-list

Questions related to this code should be sent to the [Beancount
mailing-list](https://github.com/beancount/beanlabs.git).


## History

This code used to live in the [Beancount
repository](http://github.com/beancount/beancount) under the `/experiments`
subdirectory. During the [v3 rewrite](http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/v3), I
decided to narrow the scope of the repository to just the Beancount core for
easier maintenance and to move my prototypes here.

Experiments in providing the contents of Beancount directly in a SQLite
database, without converting into an SQL schema.

Background: SQLite provides a lot of opportunities for customization and
integration. For example, you can provide data as a virtual table directly. I'd
like to experiment with this more. These are related scripts.

# Experimental Plugins

This directory contains various one-off experiments using plugins. Oftentimes
I'll be answering a question on the mailing-list and linking to a new plugin
implementation in this directory. These aren't intended as stable, but rather as
proof-of-concept codes, though some of these are probably close enough they
could be generalized, integrated and maintained in the core eventually.
